* Source Demo Tool

This is a program that is used to fix demos for source games, specifically Team Fortress 2.

It does not currently have a release, however a compiled jarfile (for Java 1.8) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/MisterVector/Source-Demo-Tool/blob/master/temp/Source%20Demo%20Tool.jar).
